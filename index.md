## HOW DRAFTS WORKS

**CAPTURE EVERYWHERE:**
Drafts opens to a new page with the keyboard ready so you can type immediately. Go hands-free with Dictation, or ask Siri to "Create a note using Drafts". Drafts lets you get things down before you forget – no choosing document templates or waiting for your file to download.

**USE YOUR WORDS:**
Drafts is a launching-off point for text – use the actions to copy it, share it, or deep link into other apps and services. Compose a tweet or message, create a file in Dropbox, send a task off to Reminders – there are hooks into tons of your favorite apps.

**REMEMBER IT NOW – OR LATER:**
New entries go into the Inbox. Once there, you can Tag them for organization, Flag them for importance, or Archive them for long-term storage.

**TAKE TEXT TO A NEW LEVEL:**
Set up a text editing experience that’s perfect for you, with tons of interface adjustments like custom fonts and control over spacing, line height, and margins. Use the customizable extended row above the keyboard to quickly convert, manipulate, and transform your writing. Make lists, use Markdown to get things just right. Process your drafts quickly using unique features like Link Mode, Arrange Mode, and Focus Mode.
